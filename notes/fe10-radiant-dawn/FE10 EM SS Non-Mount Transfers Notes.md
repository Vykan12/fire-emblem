# Part 1

## 1-P to 1-5

Same as usual

## 1-6-1

General Notes

- Zihark's bases are vastly superior to Nolan's: 6 hp/6 str/ 12 skl/15 spd/4 lck/6 def/10 res
- Can only BEXP promoted units 2 levels, better just to wait for a later chapter
- Not sure what to do with all the stat boosters that normally go to Jill. Fair chance they'll be used on either Zihark or Volug

Base

- Shop -> Shop -> Hand axe for Tauroneo (not necessary for this chapter)
- Shop -> Forge -> Full Mt iron sword for Zihark (not necessary for this chapter)

Advancement

- Skip it!

Turn 1

- Tauroneo takes out the fighter
- Shove Sothe 4 times -> Sothe fully left, equip fresh knife (1U in menu)

Turn 2

- Shove Sothe again (probably with Volug) -> Sothe moves fully

Turn 3

- Sothe moves between the two armors, attacks the priest
- Depending on the stats of the wind edge armor, might 3 or 4 turn

## 1-6-2

General Notes

- Tauroneo definitely needs to use a hand axe instead of a javelin for taking out the boss. Even with a hand axe, he's only pulling 93 display hit
- Jill ferries Tauroneo to the boss for an easy 3 turn
- Tauroneo can use a 1-range weapon on turn 2, although he only spares 2 enemies by doing this

## 1-7

General Notes

- Zihark gains 23 exp per kill, pretty significant exp gain if you give him paragon
- Zihark replaces Jill's role in the chapter

Advancement

- De-select Laura, select Zihark

## 1-8

General Notes

- Can BEXP Zihark or Volug 8 levels
- Can buy a wind edge for Zihark
- Sothe needs a 4th iron knife forge
- Volug can decently handle the enemies Nailah usually does, would benefit greatly from an energy drop. Not really worthwhile for Muarim or Vika to assist him.

## 1-9

- Same as usual

## 1-E

General Notes

- The amount of BEXP available is insane. Can BEXP Zihark to lv 18, shockingly close to third tier
- Volug is about halfway to reaching S strike
- Tentatively forging Zihark a full Mt / 15 hit steel sword for part 3
- Also placing resolve on Volug
- Zihark & Volug can build a C level support
- Volug convo gives the blue gem in case you need extra money

Base

- Manage -> Skills
 - Tormod removes celerity
 - Rafiel removes blessing
 - Fiona removes savior
 - Zihark and Volug get beastfoe and paragon (not sure in which order)

Advancement

- TODO

Chapter

- Muarim is the dominant player, should carry Micaiah
- Don't need Rafiel for the last turn
- Zihark & Muarim can team up on the last turn to clear the path for Micaiah. Zihark definitely needs a full Mt steel forge in order to 1RKO the hand axe armor.
- Actually Muarim doesn't double Jarod! And Micaiah loses 2 spaces by going around the steel greatlance armor

# Part 2

## 2-P

Could technically do a Nealuchi solo

## 2-1, 2-2

- Same as usual

## 2-3

General Notes

- A Danved solo is completely viable
- Danved needs 20 str to ORKO the door with the brave lance
- Danved has to first attack the boss on enemy phase, then finish him on player phase, otherwise he gets physic healed at the beginning of enemy phase

## 2-E

General Notes

- Can BEXP Nephenee to 20.95
- Can reliably 2 turn with a Nephenee / Calill duo. Neph uses the javelin on turn 1 & steel greatlance on turn 2, Calill just moves normally (no need to be shoved)
- Consider having Danved drop the short spear when defeating the boss (who drops a wo dao). This way Neph can use it to weaken Ludveck further, possibly removing the need to use Calill.

# Part 3

## 3-P

General Notes

- Priority is to train Boyd, he gains 40 exp per kill
- Titania & Oscar can still lead the group disarmed, although I'm not sure if this is really all that useful. Can 7 turn with just Ike assisting vs the enemies near the boss

## 3-1

General Notes

- BEXPed Boyd to lv 16, ended up with 53 hp, 24 spd, 23 def (capped)
- Boyd is amazing in this chapter, he actually ORKOed a general with a hand axe
- The normal mode strat works very well here, with Boyd swapping Titania's role. In fact, managed a reliable 3 turn
- Soren should probably be the one to get the seraph robe (remember none of the brothers can)
- Boyd needs to use a hand axe when fighting the non-moving short axe general

## 3-2

General Notes

- Can BEXP Boyd to 20.65
- Difficult to 2 turn without Boyd being promoted (need 32 str to ORKO the boss, Boyd has a tier 2 str cap of 30)
- Celerity!Haar ferrying Boyd or Neph definitely the way to go
- Can fight some of the starting enemies for self-improvement
- 3 turning costs considerable amount of time, but not the end of the world

## 3-3

General Notes

- Haar takes savior, Neph & Boyd take celerity & pass (not sure in which order)
- Effective strat: Haar ferries Ike around (focus on right side of map), Neph has pass, Boyd has celerity, Gatrie ends up being pretty useless beyond self-improvement
- Managed an 8 turn with all treasures

## 3-4

General Notes

- Giving Haar a master crown might actually prove sensible (mainly so he can use both celerity & savior)
- Base convo gives another blue gem
- Titania absolutely needs pass
- Can use the same strat as a usual speedrun, except you lose a turn since Haar cannot attack the boss with a hammer
- Neph, Gatrie and Boyd essentially useless in this chapter, only role is to kill enemies that would otherwise attack Titania

## 3-5

General Notes

- Haar drops Boyd in front of the boss, he easily ORKOes him with a tomahawk

## 3-6

General Notes

- Can BEXP Zihark to 3rd tier which gives him insane stats: 44 hp, 26 str, 23 spd, 25 def (1 away from capping!)
- Volug should get the energy drop & dracoshield
- Tentatively giving Zihark 1 of the 2 seraph robes post-promotion, holding onto the 2nd seraph robe
- Can buy a storm sword for Zihark
- Definitely a good idea to promote Jill with a master seal. Better stats + 1 movement helps a lot with her survivability.
- Volug doesn't even need beastfoe to ORKO cats
- 6 or 7 turn easily achievable
- Zihark is much more useful than Volug, to the point where I question using Volug at all in this chapter
- Zihark cannot attack Mordy or Lethe because they recruit him!
