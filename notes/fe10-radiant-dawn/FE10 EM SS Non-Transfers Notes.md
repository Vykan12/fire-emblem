# Part 1

## 1-3

Edward only trades for the door key & no need to disarm (you want him to fight the myrmidon because he's still used in combat for 1-4)

## 1-4

- Edward strat (forge +mt & +crit forge, make sure to drop door key instead of chest key)
- No need to rescue Micaiah

## 1-5

Base

- Sothe trades with Nolan for vulnerary
- Add 10 hit to Sothe's 2nd forge
- Forge Ilyana a +2 MT / +10 hit thunder tome

Advancement

- Reposition Aran & Laura

Turn 1

- Edward attacks after Volug, everything else is pretty much the same

## 1-6-1

- Jill gets all the BEXP
- Put crit on her forge

## 1-6-2

- Use the old advancement & turn 1 strat (make sure Jill attacks wind edge cav from the right and cantoes 1L for maximum enemy exposure)
- Turn 2: `Z + A + A` to Jill, she attacks the cav from above, canto 2U
- Turn 3: Jill moves fully up, attacks boss

## 1-E

- Last turn: After Jill's move, X to Nailah. She gives Volug the chest key & he opens the bottom chest (move fully right then mash A)

# Part 2

## 2-1

Exact strategy, follow this to the letter:

- Turns 1-3: Same as before
- Turn 4: If under 20 hp, heal with an herb. Otherwise, end turn.
- Turn 5: Nephenee moves fully up - 1 (don't attack!). With any luck, you'll get a wrath countercrit on enemy phase.
- Turn 6: Nephenee fully down, 1L, heal with a vulnerary, then Brom recruits Heather. With any luck, the boss will die on enemy phase
- Turn 7: Nephenee can once again move to the edge of Ludveck's range and heal. This outcome should occur fairly rarely.

Note: Vulnerary is always 1D. The position of the herb varies, so pay attention on enemy phase.

## 2-3

- BEXP Geoffrey so he gains +1 str
- Use the old strat (it's pretty mindless, after turn 2 Kieran always moves before Geoffrey)
- Turn 1: Marcia moves 1st, then Kieran (don't canto after the 1-range kill!), then Geoffrey goes fully up
- On the 2nd to last turn, Kieran trades for 3 of Geoffrey's items (steel greatlance, short spear & concoction, should be `right + A` then mashing in the trade menu) and attacks the door with the hand axe. Geoffrey does his usual move.
- On the last turn, Kieran finishes the halberdier (mash A)

## 2-E

- BEXP Haar before giving him the hammer & speedwing. This way, if he caps speed naturally, you can give it to Geoffrey so he can do the solo strat in 3-9.

# Part 3

## 3-P

Base

- Do the Oscar x Gatrie trade

Turn 1

- Titania attacks the warrior with the short axe, this way Rolf can finish him off in case she doesn't double

Turn 2

- Mia attacks the warrior with the wo dao (instead of the mage with the steel sword)
- Oscar takes out the mage
- Titania either finishes the warrior (if still alive) or weakens the SM. In either case, use the hand axe (1U in menu)

Turn 4

- If the SM is still alive, have Mia finish it off
- If Titania fails to ORKO the halberdier (which she probably will), your 6 turn is screwed since you can't rescue-drop Ike properly

Turn 5

- Oscar rescues Ike (& drops him next turn)
- Titania finishes the halberdier with a steel poleax (2D in menu)

Turn 6

- Improvise the rest

## 3-1

Base

- BEXP Oscar to 22 spd in case he hasn't reached it already (pretty rare)
- BEXP Titania as usual

Turn 1

- Soren now attacks the archer
- Oscar attacks halberdier from the left using the steel greatlance (1U in menu), no canto
- Off-X to Mist then 1U to Rolf. He gives Shinon his steel bow (`down + A, down + A` in trade menu)

Turn 3

- Ike gets the seraph robe (Giffca uses it in 4-E base)

## 3-2

- Titania gives short axe, hand axe, vulnerary & crossbow (if necessary), takes 4 hand axes

## 3-3

Don't bother with blossom

## 3-6

- Pray Zihark doesn't die (although it's not a runkiller if he does)

## 3-8

- Janaff no longer trades with Ulki & Kyza (only does the Mordy trade)

## 3-9

Note: Geoffrey strat is simple: BEXP him to promotion, use the speedwing, leave base. Only works in the rare cases Geoffrey has 23 spd before promotion.

Base

- Info -> Elincia (for master crown)
- If Kieran has less than 22 str, BEXP him until he does
- Leave base (no joke)

Advancement

- De-select Marcia
- Reposition Mak & Kieran

Turn 1

- Danved blocks the ledge, off X
- Geoffrey advances right
- Kieran fully right + up, trades with Geoffrey for the master crown (`up-right + A, down, down + A` in trade menu) and uses it

Turn 2

- Geoffrey attacks halberdier blocking his path, cantoes 1U
- Kieran moves below Geoffrey, attacks soldier with steel poleax

Turn 3

- Geoffrey takes out the armor, NO CANTO
- Kieran kills the archer, moves above Geoffrey

Turn 4

- Kieran kills the short spear halberdier, cantoes 1U
- Geoffrey moves 1R of Kieran (the special spot on the stairs)

Turn 5

- Kieran injures the boss with a hand axe
- Geoffrey finishes off (he attacks 2nd in order to avoid the risk of a counterattack)

## 3-11

- BEXP Tanith to 28 str

## 3-12

- Do the Pelleas & Tauroneo convos (master crown & boots, respectively)
- Tauroneo retrieves & uses the speedwing and master crown, and DOESN'T give-all
- If Zihark died in 3-6, you need to reposition Jill in advancement
- Everything else is the same

## 3-E

- Ike give-all (in order to get rid of the seraph robe)
- Tanith doesn't yet have the lance rank to use the spear (don't let this freak you out, she increases her rank using the horseslayer)
- On turn 1, Ike still have to equip the ragnell (fortunately you can just mash A)
- Everything else is the same

## 4-1

- Jill only takes 2 hand axes & forges + pure water (Tauroneo has hammer & needs brave axe in 4-2)

## 4-2

- Tauroneo does give-all, takes forged hand axe, brave axe & hammer
- De-select everyone but Tanith, then re-select Tauroneo & Reyson individually. You can then start the map without any repositioning.
- It is critical that Tibarn attacks the warrior above him on turn 1, otherwise Reyson will get attacked

Tauroneo

- Turn 1: Equip hammer (1U in menu)
- Turn 2: Equip brave axe (1U in menu)
- Turn 3: Attack the crossbow halberdier from below
- Turn 4: Equip forged hand axe (1U in menu)
- Turn 5: Move fully left

Note: Always manual switch from Tibarn to Tanith in order to skip switching to Elincia

## 4-3

- Move Sigrun first and off-X to Micaiah (should do this in transfers as well)

## 4-4

On turn 3, Ike can move up 2 spacs instead of 3 (also valid in transfers)

## 4-E-1

Base

- Manage -> Skills -> Give Haar parity (as usual)
- Items
 - 1U to Giffca -> convoy -> take & use seraph robe
 - 1U back to top, scroll to Haar -> list -> swap brave lance for 2nd hand axe
 - Scroll down to Jill -> list -> take Tauroneo's brave axe & hammer
- BEXP Ike (if less than 32 str), Giffca (+3 str) & Cain (+2 str)

## 4-E-2

- It is far more likely that you'll need to BEXP Ike to 34 spd (since it's common for him not to cap his tier 2 speed in non-transfers). Fortunately, you might have a leftover 2-3 speedwing if neither Haar nor Geoffrey needed it (decently likely)
