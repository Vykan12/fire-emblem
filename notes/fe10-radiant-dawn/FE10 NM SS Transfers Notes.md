# New Strats

Ike x Titania support doesn't work since Titania has the LIGHT affinity (not HEAVEN)
As an alternative, could bliss Ike on a specific turn of 3-10 to manipulate his 4-E-5 biorhythm

***

Get Nailah to 40 spd, make her attack the aura Ike normally does

# Part 1

## 1-P

General Notes

- Don't have Micaiah attack on turn 3, it actually puts Edward in more danger of dying since it ensures he ORKOes an extra bandit
- Pugo does 13 damage to base level Edward

Turn 1

- Same as on easy mode

Turn 2

- Micaiah 2D, attack
- Edward 2DR, attack

Turn 3

- Edward 3DR, attack

Turn 4

- Edward heals

Turn 5

- Edward 1R, 1UR, heals

Remaining turns

- Heal strategically to maximize wrath counter-crits

## 1-1

General Notes

- Edward only risks dying on turn 2 enemy phase if he didn't gain any hp or def up to this point (rather unlikely)
- Healing Nolan on turn 3 is pointless unless he has less than 6 hp

Turn 1

- Micaiah moves fully
- Edward fully up - 1
- Leo moves fully
- Nolan attacks javelin soldier

Turn 2

- Micaiah 1UL, attack
- Leo 1R, attack
- Edward 1U, attack (riskiest aspect of this strat)
- Nolan uses a vulnerary

Turn 3

- Micaiah moves fully up-left, attacks
- Edward moves above Micaiah, heals with vulnerary
- Leo moves fully up-left, attacks fighter guarding the hand axe house
- Nolan moves left of Micaiah, heals (if necessary)

Turn 4

- Edward gets the hand axe
- Leo fully up -1, attacks hand axe fighter
- Nolan finishes the hand axe fighter
- Micaiah escapes

## 1-2

General Notes

- It's better to have Nolan attack on turn 3 instead of healing

Turn 1

- Miciah moves 1R, 1UR (spot below right ledge)
- Edward trades with Nolan, gives him a hand axe
- Nolan moves 1R
- Laura fully up, 1R
- End turn

Turn 2

- End turn

Turn 3

- `Down + X + X` to Nolan, he heals with a vulnerary

- Sothe fully right, attacks
- End turn

Turn 7

- `Y-switch 1U` to Sothe, he opens the energy drop chest
- `Y-switch 1U` to Laura, she arrives

## 1-3

General Notes

- If the myrmidon opts to attack Ilyana instead of Sothe, you can still have Laura heal Ilyana on turn 3
- If Ilyana moves fully left on turn 3, you can probably avoid an awkward manual switch to her

Turn 1

- Micaiah directs fully left - 1, moves fully right - 1
- `2L` to Sothe, he moves fully right + down & attacks the fighter, X
- Nolan fully right, rescues Micaiah, `right + X, 1R`
- Ilyana d-pad fully down-right, `up + X`
- Leo moves right of Ilyana, rescues her

- Laura fully right + down-right
- End turn

Turn 2

- Manual switch to Nolan
- Nolan fully down + down-right, breaks door, X
- Laura fully right + down, X
- Ilyana fully right + down, attacks archer, X
- Edward fully right + down - 1, takes Micaiah & shoves Ilyana, X
- Leo fully right + down - 1, shoves Edward, X
- Sothe attacks the archer
- End turn

Turn 3

- Edward 2DL, drop Micaiah to the left
- Sothe attacks the armor from the right, X + manual switch to Ilyana
- Ilyana fully left - 1, attacks hand axe fighter
- End turn

Turn 4

- Ilyana and Edward shove Micaiah, manual switch to Sothe
- Sothe kills the archer, off-X
- Micaiah escapes

## 1-4

General Notes

- Can have Sothe move towards the north-east enemies and tail back to get the master seal. Should look into this. Pretty sure the issue with such an approach is that an untransformed enemy blocks Sothe's path at some point.
- Can 4 turn without beastfoe. Only issue is shoving Ilyana twice in order to get the seraph robe. Actually there's a tiger in the left portion of the map that seems to ruin the 4 turn.

## 1-6-1

General Notes

- Need to start the base with BEXPing Jill since you want to do this before she promotes with the master seal
- 5 turning is bad because you face 5 extra reinforcements
- If Jill misses an enemy on turn 1, Tauroneo can clean up after her the next turn (before she rescues him)

# Part 2

- End turn

Turn 7

- End turn

Turn 8

- Elincia heals Marcia
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 2-1

General Notes

- Nephenee should attack the archer from below. This way, the armor attacks her at 2 range and stays alive. Then on player phase, Brom can finish the armor and Neph can safely 1HKO the venin edge myrmidon.

Turn 1

- Nephenee above Brom, attacks javelin soldier
- Brom fully down, attacks hand axe fighter

Turn 2

- Nephenee attacks archer from below
- Brom attacks the javelin armor

Note: The rest of the map is improvised. Make sure to recruit Heather before moving Nephenee next to the boss.

## 2-2

General Notes

- 3 turning isn't viable, requires crits

Turn 1

- `2DL` -> Heather fully up, `B-switch`

- Nephenee fully up + 1R, attacks the armor, `off-X + X`

- Mordy fully right, finish general, manual switch to Leanne
- Leanne vigors Lucia
- Lucia fully right, escapes
- End of chapter

## 2-3

General Notes

- A more pacifist approach might ensure Haar has enough BEXP to promote in 2-E
- Battle save at the end of turn 3 if in a race. The horseslayer cav has 3 display hit on Geoffrey and 9 on Kieran (0.21 and 1.71 real hit, respectively). This might vary based on enemy biorhythm, it was at worst when I checked.
- There's a backup strat if Geoffrey needs to heal on turn 5. Basically, Kieran opens the gate with the steel poleax and Geoffrey initiates the trade. However, this might be unnecessary if healing on turn 4 is better.

Base

- Shop -> Shop -> Buy hammer
- Info -> 3 convos
- Leave base

Advancement

- Un-deploy Astrid

Turn 1

- `1DL` -> Marcia 1L, XX

- Geoffrey fully up, attack, canto 1D, skip boss text
- End turn

Turn 5

- Kieran attacks the speedwing halberdier with the silver poleax (2D in menu), gives the speedwing to convoy

- Haar fully down, equips hammer
- End turn
- End of chapter

# Part 3

## 3-P

General Notes

- A single ballista hit on a halberdier doesn't weaken him enough for a tiger to 1HKO
- Ballista attacks on the generals only do 3 damage
- Need to figure out a ballista strategy beyond turn 2 (if there's even any point in using them)

Base

- Titania trades with Boyd for the killer axe & hand axe

Turn 1

- Gatrie does his usual moves, `B-switch`
- Ike fully up + up-left, attacks the SM, `B-switch`
- Titania fully up + up-left, attacks the warrior with the killer axe (2D in menu), `left + X, 1UL`

- Oscar fully up + left
- End turn

- Boyd fully up - 1, shoves Rolf
- Rolf attacks with the ballista (mash A), `B-switch`
- Ike fully up, `2DL`
- Oscar trades with Gatrie for the steel greatlance, finishes the warrior with the new lance (1U in menu), cantoes fully up + up-right + up, `B-switch`

- Titania fully up + up-right, attacks the general (target d-pad up), canto 1R, `1DL, 1D`
- Oscar fully up, attacks the mage, canto 2UR
- End turn

Turn 4

- Ike 2UR, attacks horseslayer general, `1U`
- Oscar 1R, finish general, no canto, `B-switch`
- Titania moves to the top-right corner of her movement
 - If she needs to heal, equip short axe (2U in menu) & use vulnerary (1U in menu)
 - Otherwise, attack with the short axe (1U in menu)
- End turn

Turn 5

- Ike 1R, `1U`
- Oscar rescues Ike, canto fully right + up-right + right, `B-switch`
- Titania fully right - 1, rescue drops Ike, canto 1D
- End turn

- `1DL` -> Titania attacks the general from below with the steel poleax (1U in menu), canto around the revealed general next to the bishop, `B-switch`
- Ike moves next to boss, weakens general
- Oscar attacks any nearby enemies that aren't the boss, general or bishop
- End turn

Turn 7 (if necessary): Improvise

## 3-1

General Notes

- Even if Gatrie doesn't double the halberdier on turn 2 enemy phase, he'll still finish him off next enemy phase
- Gatrie is very effective handling the southern generals when using the steel greatlance (he ORKOes all of them)
- Ike is best suited at handling the northwest portion of the map. He has better accuracy than Oscar & Gatrie, and is the least threatened of dying to a boss crit.
- Titania should go northeast since she has the best 1-2 range on the map and has the movement to reach the hidden halberdier who doesn't move.

Base

- Skip it!

Turn 1

- Ike fully up + up-left, direct halt, attack the halberdier, `B-switch`
- Titania fully up + up-right, 1DL, attack the halberdier with a killer axe (1U in menu), canto 1R, `B-switch, 1R`

- End turn

- Titania fully right + up, attacks halberdier with the hand axe (1U in menu), canto 1UR, `B-switch`
- Soren spam A, `1DL`

- Gatrie fully right - 1

Turn 3

- Ike mash A, `3R`
- Shinon 1L, attacks the boss with the killer bow, `1DR, 1D`
- Rolf fully up, finishes the short spear halberdier, `1DR`
- Soren visits the seraph robe village, `B-switch`
- Titania mash A, canto fully up + up-left
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 3-2

General Notes

- Haar having the speedwing means he only receives one hand axe. This proves to be problematic in 3-7, so he should probably take a 2nd hand axe after giving his steel axe & javelin. Maybe he could even keep the javelin for 3-7 (tested, doesn't work out. Hitrate issues vs axe enemies and fails to ORKO wyverns).

Base

- Info -> Item Shop (silver card)
- Manage -> Award Exp -> BEXP Haar to --/20/2 (32 str)
- Manage -> Skills
 - Haar takes celerity & savior
 - Heather removes pass
 - Shinon removes provoke
- Shop -> Armory -> Buy a bronze axe & max amount of hand axes for Haar
- Items
 - Ike list -> puts the brave sword at top of inventory
 - Titania convoy -> gives the hand axe (default) & short axe (2U), takes a hand axe (1U)
 - Haar gives the steel axe & javelin, takes a hand axe (1R, 2D), then uses the speedwing
- Leave base

Advancement & Chapter - Same as easy mode

## 3-3

Same as easy mode, except Ike has to break the gate a turn early. He kills the general on enemy phase (remember he has the brave sword equipped) and burns the supplies next turn. This is a workaround for Titania no longer having pass.

## 3-4

General Notes

- Since Titania no longer has pass, she needs savior in order to ensure she can move far enough to hand off Ike to Haar
- If you don't BEXP Ike to some extent, he can die when dropped at the top of the mountain. He doesn't necessarily need to be brought to lv 18 though.
- If Ranulf has 17 meter or more, he doesn't need to use olivi grass

Base

- Skip it initially (this recruits Ranulf)
- Do the usual advancement & return to base
- Manage -> Award Exp
 - BEXP Titania to promotion
 - Give Ike the remaining BEXP
- Manage -> Skills
 - Ranulf takes pass
 - Haar removes savior
 - Titania takes savior

Turn 1

- Ike moves left of Titania (doesn't unequip the brave sword)
- Titania doesn't need to switch weapons before rescuing Ike
- Rest is the same

Turn 2

- Don't need to be precise with Haar's move so long as you move him onto the correct tile for dropping Ranulf
- Rest is the same

Turn 3 onwards: Same as easy mode. Note that Ranulf has to use olivi grass even if he has 17 meter left.

## 3-5

Same as easy mode

## 3-6

General Notes

- Jill should always promote on turn 2 player phase since it provides her a free heal
- Should heal Sothe on turn 6 regardless of how much health he has since he gets attacked by 3 tigers (each doing 10-12 damage)
- Zihark doesn't actually help in this map, as he dies too easily and doesn't impact the final turn count. Need to wait for all the NPCs to die, then the Black Knight kills all the transformed laguz in a single enemy phase.
- Since Zihark is no longer needed, neither is beastfoe in 1-4!
- It is rather helpful to have Sothe at 24 spd so that he can double cats
- 28 str required to ORKO the stronger tigers
- Should get rid of Lethe's spd transfer

Base

- Info -> First 2 convos
- Manage -> Award Exp
 - BEXP Jill fully (she reaches lv 13-14)
 - (Optional) If Sothe is at 23 spd, BEXP him 1 level
- Shop -> Shop -> Buy Sothe a concoction & beastkiller
- Items -> Jill trades with Micaiah, swaps hand axe for the master crown (`A, up + A`)
- Leave base

Advancement

- De-select everyone except Jill
- Re-position Jill & empty slot 2R of her

Turn 1

## 3-7

- Same as easy mode, except:
- Titania needs to equip the steel poleax on turn 1

## 3-8

General Notes

- Janaff has 44 Mt, same as 29 str Titania with the steel poleax, so there's no real advantage in using him
- The main draw of using Janaff over Titania is that Titania has serious hitrate issues in the chapter (steel poleax has low hit, SMs have high avoid)

Base

- Items
 - Haar give-all, takes a tomahawk then 6 hand axes
 - Janaff trades with Mordy for the olivi grass & laguz stone
 - Janaff trades with Ulki, gives him the laguz stone
 - Janaff trades with Kyza for his laguz stone
- Shop -> Sell items -> Sell the blue gem & any coins
- Shop -> Forge -> Forge Titania a full Mt / full hit hand axe
- Manage -> Award Exp -> BEXP Haar to capped str (Ok if he doesn't cap though)
- Manage -> Skills
 - Titania removes savior
 - Ranulf removes pass (could also do it in 4-2)
 - Haar takes savior

Advancement

- De-select Rolf, select Reyson
- Reposition:
 - Ulki & Reyson
 - Ulki & Haar
 - Boyd & Titania
- Start map

Turn 1

- Ike 1UR, `1R`
- Haar fully down, 1UL, attack armor with hand axe (1D in menu), `X`
- Titania fully right + down, attack SM with the killer axe (1D in menu), canto 1L, manual switch to Reyson
- Reyson fully down, vigors Haar
- Haar rescues Reyson, cantoes right of the steel greatlance general
- End turn

Turns 2 onwards: Same as easy mode, except:

- On turn 2, Haar attacks the general 2 spaces above him before cantoing to his usual spot
- On turn 4, Haar 1R, attacks bishop with the tomahawk, canto 4D (1UR of fire mage)

## 3-9

General Notes

- If you BEXP Kieran to gain 2 str, he can 2HKO the boss with the steel poleax. Problematic due to lack of BEXP.
- Geoffrey needs 23 spd to quadruple halberdiers, which is important for ORKOing them when they spawn with high hp / def
- Un-deploy Marcia or she will die to the sniper reinforcement

Base

- Manage -> Award Exp -> BEXP Geoffrey to 23 spd (if he hasn't reached it already)
- Manage -> Skills
 - Geoffrey removes paragon, `1R`
 - Calill removes nihil, `2D`
 - Astrid removes paragon
- Info -> Elincia (master crown)

Advancement

- Un-deploy Calill, Marcia & Astrid
- Re-deploy Calill
- Start map

Turn 1

- `1R` -> Calill fully up + up-left + up-right, mash A to hit the soldier with meteor, `down + X`
- Geoffrey fully right, direct halt, attack SM, canto fully right, `B-switch`
- Kieran fully right + up, trades with Geoffrey
 - If Geoffrey doesn't have the arms scroll, do `up-right + A, up + A, up + A, up + A`
 - If Geoffrey does have the arms scroll, [TODO]
 - In either case, Kieran must have paragon, master crown & short spear. He then promotes (2U in menu), no canto.
- End turn

Turn 2

- Geoffrey 3U, attack halberdier, canto 1U, X
- Kieran 2UR, attack archer (2D in menu, target d-pad right), canto 1UL (below Geoffrey), `B-switch + 2U`
- Calill mash A (finishes the soldier), `down + X (or 2D)`
- Makalov 1U, trades with Calill for her meteor tome
- End turn

Turn 3

- Geoffrey 1U, attacks general or heals with a concoction (depending on hp), X
- Kieran fully up or 1U (depending on what Geoffrey did)
- End turn

Turn 4

- Geoffrey 2UL (into the range of the speedwing halberdier), X
- Kieran fully up, attack halberdier with the silver axe (1D in menu), canto 1UR
- End turn

Turn 5

- `X` -> Kieran attacks the boss
- End turn

Turn 6

- `X` -> Kieran finishes the boss
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 3-10

General Notes

- The paladin in Reyson's range is programmed to prioritize Elincia for some reason
- Ike's brave sword usage is too low to be of much help
- Even though Ike can cap his level naturally, BEXP is preferable since it forces him to gain resistance, which offsets the risk of the sleep staff in 4-4
- Consider selling a blue gem (either here or in 3-2) so that Titania can afford a hand axe forge

Base

- Manage -> Award Exp
 - BEXP Titania to 32 str (31 str is acceptable)
 - (Optional) BEXP Ike to lv 20

Advancement

- Same as easy mode

Turn 1

- Ike 1L, `left + X, 1DL`
- Rolf 1D, rescues Mist, `2U`
- Haar fully right, attack default halberdier with fresh hand axe (1U in menu), canto fully up, 1DL, `X`
- Titania fully right, attack halberdier with the forged hand axe (1U in menu), no canto, `X, 1R`
- Reyson moves left of Haar (below the tree), vigors, `1R`
- Haar 6R, 1U, attack paladin with fresh hand axe (1U in menu), canto fully right + 1UL
- End turn

Turn 2

- Haar does his usual move, X
- Titania fully right + down-right, attack wyrmslayer paladin (target d-pad right)
- End turn

Turn 3

- Haar does his usual move, X
- Titania moves into the 2-range of both bishops, attacks with a fresh hand axe (1D in menu)
- End turn

Turn 4

- Haar does his usual move
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 3-11

General Notes

- Haar needs 29 spd to double the boss
- Titania needs 32 str to ORKO the sword paladin with a hand axe. If he survives, he will be rescue staffed & healed twice, wasting a considerable amount of time

Chapter

- Same as easy mode except:
 - Don't return to the base to BEXP anyone (unless Titania needs it)
 - Titania uses the same hand axe on turn 1
 - Haar might have to go 2U in menu for his turn 2 hand axe because he can break a hand axe in turn 1 of 3-10, meaning he keeps the silver bow the 3-10 boss drops

## 3-12

General Notes

- Because of the forged iron axe drop mid-enemy phase onto the forged steel axe, Jill only needs 29 str in this chapter
- There's a javelin soldier that climbs up the ledge next to Tauroneo and attacks an NPC sniper up the ledge. Based on the enemy's spd stat, the sniper may or may not ORKO. If he doesn't, several enemies get stuck below the ledge.

Base

- Info -> First 3 convos (master crown, boots, 10k gold). Sothe gives the concoction when acquiring the boots.
- Items
 - Jill trades with Sothe for the boots & uses it
 - Jill convoy -> take an iron sword (to fill her inventory)
 - Tauroneo list -> takes & uses the master crown
- Shop -> Armory -> Buy Tauroneo 8 hand axes [subject to change]
- Leave base

Advancement

- Reposition
 - Zihark & Leo
 - Zihark & Jill
- Start map

Turn 1

- Micaiah direct halt, `right + X`
- Tauroneo fully down, equip hand axe (1U in menu), X
- Jill fully down-left + down-right, select the forged steel axe for attacking (2U in menu), cancel, attack with the forged iron axe (scroll down in menu), `X + 3R`
- Volug halfshifts
- End turn
- Jill drops the forged iron axe on enemy phase (which automatically equips the forged steel axe)

Turn 2

- `Right + X` -> Tauroneo mash A, X
- [If 5 enemies remain] Jill fully down + left, attack
- [If 7 enemies remain] Jill 1D, attack, canto fully down + left
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 3-13

General Notes

- Want to BEXP Ike as little as possible such that he can still handle combat in 3-4 and 3-11. Ike's speed and avoid are very problematic for Jill.
- Don't want Edward to give-all since we want him to fight in 3-E

Base

- Info -> Veterans (tempest blade)
- Manage -> Award Exp -> BEXP Jill fully (reaches level 12)
- Items -> Edward gives the tempest blade (so Tanith can use it in part 4)

Advancement

- Reposition
 - Volug & Edward
 - Leo & Jill
- Start map

Chapter

- Same as easy mode, except:
- Need to do manual switches to Volug and Jill on both turns
- Jill doesn't need to equip the steel poleax on turn 1
- Jill should send her current axe when she gets the olivi grass on enemy phase (makes it easier to select the brave axe when attacking Ike)
- Battle save before attacking Ike since Jill's hitrate is hardly reliable (65-71 display hit)

## 3-E

General Notes

- Bishop has a 33% chance of putting Haar to sleep. Unfortunately, ward isn't available until 4-E-5! The turn 1 battle save is critical.
- Can't forge silver weapons yet!

Base

- Manage -> Skills
 - Ike takes paragon

## Army Selection

- Janaff & Gatrie
- Makalov & Boyd
- Kieran & Oscar
- Jill & Shinon
- Haar & Tanith
- Tanith & Gatrie

## 4-P

General Notes

- The tempest blade general doesn't attack Haar unless he's adjacent to him. This is why we have to take him out on turn 2 player phase, which in turn forces Naesala to take out the longbow paladin.
- Can't BEXP Naesala because you have to go to advancement and return to the base. Might as well do it in 4-3 base instead.

Base

- Items
 - Skrimir trades with Sothe, takes olivi grass
 - Skrimir goes to convoy, takes & uses a speedwing
 - Haar gives 2 used hand axes, takes 2 fresh hand axes

Turn 1

- Naesala 4R, attack longbow paladin, canto fully up & 1DL, XX
- Haar 5R, drop current hand axe, attack tempest blade general, canto 1D
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 4-1

General Notes

- 2 turning seems possible, but 3 turning is flat out better since you only face 1 reinforcement
- If Ike doesn't have enough spd to double Catalina and misses a hit, you will lose a turn

Base

- Manage -> Skills
 - Nailah removes pass
 - Janaff takes savior
 - Jill removes paragon, takes pass
- Manage -> Award exp -> BEXP Jill to 35 str (if necessary)
- Items

Turn 3

- Ike moves 4R1D (2 spaces above Catalena), attacks her (target d-pad up), manual switch to Titania
- Titania mash A
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 4-2

General Notes

- Do you even need Tanith to use a 1-2 range weapon on turn 2?
- 5 turn strat (6 if Tanith has to use an elixir at any point)
- If an extra unit covers the starting area reinforcements, this frees up Elincia to potentially physic heal the last 2 turns. She's probably too far away though.

Base

- Manage -> Skills

- Manage -> Award Exp
 - BEXP Elincia to 24 str / 26 spd (+3 str / +2 spd)

- Tanith fully left, attack bishop
- Battle save (to offset the risk of Tibarn dying to a Taksh crit)
- End turn
- End of chapter

## 4-3

General Notes

- Haar's remaining forged hand axe usage is concerning, depending on how turn 6 plays out
- Haar misses a fair amount throughout the chapter, might want to give him one or two +hit forges
- Want Sothe & Sanaki to alternate between kills so neither unit levels up
- Haar can barely manage with a fresh forge for 2 turns. He has at most 13 uses on turn 1 (due to a guaranteed 1HKO on the bishop) and 12 on turn 2. Although this means the forge will break most of the time, this is better than the alternative of making Haar a 4th hand axe forge.
- Impossible to 6 turn with the current strat because there's a physic bishop with ellight near Skrimir who doesn't move. If Skrimir takes him out, he's in Yumida's purge range, which means Haar has to attack him instead of Lekain on player phase. There's also the issue of the 29 spd SM next to Haar, can only 1RKO him with stun.

Base

- Manage -> Award Exp -> BEXP Naesala so he gains 2 str (2nd point needed for 4-E-5)
- Leave base

Advancement

## 4-4

General Notes

- 36 str Ike managed just fine in the chapter
- Nailah is 1 str short of cleanly ORKOing the generals near Oliver (also needs +1 str in 4-E-1)

- Leave base

- Titania mash A
- End of chapter

## 4-5

General Notes

- Untransformed Mordy cannot smite Tanith. In addition, Tibarn must remove a skill in order to take smite. Halfshift on Mordy would therefore be the most viable option for the non-pass strat. Note that Mordy still needs to switch armies.
- Can 1 turn without pass if Elincia has 20 mag. Just need Tibarn to shove Tanith. Could even give Tibarn smite or give Mordy halfshift & have him switch armies.
- Bastian cannot 1HKO the laguz preventing a non-pass clear even with blizzard / meteor effective damage

Base

- Manage -> Skills -> Tanith removes paragon, takes pass
- Items -> Elincia takes the rescue staff from convoy

Advancement

- Reposition Tanith & Ranulf

 - Tanith removes pass, takes nullify, `1UL, scroll up to Jill`

 - Titania takes pass, `scroll up`

- Select Nailah, Titania, Jill
- Select Tibarn, Elincia, Tanith
- Select Caineghis, Giffca
- Pick Rafiel as your heron

## 4-E-1

General Notes

- The biggest issue with the 2 turn is keeping Titania alive, which is solved by putting Tanith above her on turn 1 (protecting her from mage attacks), giving her pass so she can heal on turn 2, and letting Haar take out Lekain instead of her
- Elincia needs 26 str (possibly 27) to ORKO the brave axe general

Advancement

- De-select Sothe, Sanaki, Kurth, Ena

## 4-E-5

General Notes

- If Haar attacks the thunder spirit, Titania rescues Rafiel instead of Tanith (Tanith doesn't move at all)
- Tanith's hitrate with a full hit forged silver sword is in the low 80s, not an improvement over Naesala's hitrate. Unfortunately she is at worst biorhythm at the start of the chapter.

Backups

If anyone misses twice in a row, you're screwed. Incredibly rare though.

Turn 1

- Ike misses once -> already covered by Nailah's doubling freeing up Haar
- Naesala misses once -> Nothing changes

Turn 2

- Naesala misses once -> Titania finishes with the forged hand axe. She might have to attack before Tibarn to ensure his survival.
